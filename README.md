# Tour-Management-Website
Hello! It's me Doel Moy Tripura. There are two members in our Web Engineering group-Me and my friend Sojan Tripura. Our project name is "Tour Management Website". A tour management website is an online platform designed to facilitate the organization, coordination, and management of travel tours and related services. It provides tour operators and travel agencies with tools to create, manage, and promote tour packages. Key features typically include itinerary planning, booking and reservation management, customer relationship management (CRM), payment processing, and real-time updates. The website may also offer marketing tools, analytics, and reporting capabilities to help businesses optimize their operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
